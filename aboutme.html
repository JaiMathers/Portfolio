                    I'm a retail worker with a passion for tech that needs an outlet. I've spent a lot of my life being awed by technology and the tasks it can accomplish, always wanting to understand more about how it all works. After years of building computers for myself, friends, and family I sought to try my hand at something more mentally stimulating.

                <p>
                    I was visiting a close friend of mine who had said he had something to show me that he was super excited about, naturally I also started to get restless in anticipation. He takes me through to his garage, and there he has 3 monitors, an LED light bar, and a bunch of intimidating coloured text, arms outstretched exclaiming "Ta da! I did a coding thing, check it out!". Impressed by his project, I was inspired and became more interested in what was possible with coding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After working for years in retail I was looking for something to get me out of my rut, something to bring back the enthusiasm I craved for being challenged and overcoming obstacles, so my friend seeing my struggle, patted my shoulder and suggested "Why not go and try a coding course?" I decided to throw my hesitancy to the wind and dive in, landing myself in the Coder Academy Web Development course.
